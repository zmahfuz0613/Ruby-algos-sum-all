## Mini Algorithm Exercise: "Sum All"

_Language: Ruby_

_Difficulty Rating: Easy_

### Objectives

- Create a method, `sum_all`, which takes a single parameter as an input, `arr`, an array of two integers.
- Return the sum of all numbers between– and including– the two numbers in `arr`.

> i.e.:
>
> input => `[3,6]`
>
> output => `18`

### Restrictions & Edge Cases

- The first number will always be less than or equal to the second number.

### Getting Started

- Fork and clone this repo.
- `cd` into the repo directory
- Run `bundle` from within the repo.
- Run `rspec` in the root of the repo to make sure the tests work. (They should fail.)
- Get hacking on the problem and test when you think you've got it!

Pull requests due by 11pm. Happy hacking!
